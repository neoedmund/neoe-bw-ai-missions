# Introduction #

Episode I is all finished. not all by AI. but with AI assistance.


# Details #

In this mission, enemy is not so easy to be flooded by the forces.
however I was frustrated by my AI. Only mining department is handy. It always trains enough
> SCV and make my money grow steadly without care.
the build department go into a situation of rear performance issue, It seems buddy. and built things too close, always block the ways.
the train department is also poor, It use dices, but not build the right things and right combination. and bad micro control,  no assistance, it is easily being destroyed my enemy.

And, I reach a pinch with C++ language. I thought I should do better is use java or python.

What should to do next? start another episode, or make episode I solution better. or just go to 1 one 1 research?
However my job become busier and maybe leave for a while.
