This is a project for fun.

Maybe you played [starcraft/broodwar](http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=110000124) episodes of single player [missions](http://strategywiki.org/wiki/StarCraft/Walkthrough) years ago,
thanks to [bwapi](http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/), we can write [c++](http://www.microsoft.com/express/download) code to "play" the missions again.

i am not good at c++. for me, its playing game, AI practice, also C++ learning.

if you achieved some missions you could submit your code too.

see [FinishedMissions](FinishedMissions.md)

Q: How can I try playing it?

A: first, read [bwapi](http://code.google.com/p/bwapi/) and success to run broodwar with bwapi plugin. then copy [the latest AI dll file](http://neoe-bw-ai-missions.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ExampleAIModule/Release/NeoeAI.dll) into StarCraft\bwapi-data\AI\ dir which you should know where it is. then start the game and play single players mission.

then you can sit there and see the missions being completed by the program.

You may also find another project [JBW](https://code.google.com/p/jbw/) interesting. That has a game play helper.
